Explanation
Test Case 1: Substitute 3rd character in string A with character 'k' and 2nd character in string B with character 'a'. Thus, both strings can be converted to "baking".

Test Case 2: These strings cannot be made equal as some of the characters do not match. For instance, the second character in both the strings are 'c' and 'a' respectively and hence cannot be made equal.

Test Case 3: Both strings can be converted to "raft".
