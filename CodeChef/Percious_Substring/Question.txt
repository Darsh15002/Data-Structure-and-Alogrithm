Precious Substrings 		Problem Code: PSUBS

In Chefland, a string is considered precious if it both begins and ends with '1'. Such substrings are provided maximum level security for protection against robbers.

Given a binary string (consisting of only 0's and 1's) S of length N. Determine the number of precious substrings in the string so that they can be provided protection.

A substring is defined as a sequence of continuous characters Si,Si+1,...,Sj where 1≤i≤j≤N.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line of each test case contains a single string S.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of precious substrings.

Constraints
1≤T≤105
1≤N≤105
Sum of N over all testcases ≤105

Explanation
Test Case 1: Substrings S[1,1], S[3,3] and S[1,3] are precious.

Test Case 2: All substrings are precious.

S[i,j] denotes substring from index i to j.
