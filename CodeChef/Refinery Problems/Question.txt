Refinery Problem                      Problem Code: REFINERY

A local oil refinery gets E units of electricity everyday. It has to construct several machines in order to begin production. 
It can construct any number of machines between 1 and M. All the machines will equally distribute the total amount of electricity available among themselves. 
Each machine will get the same units of electricity and this amount is maximum possible. The remaining amount of electricity gets saved and is used for other purposes. 
Determine the maximum amount of electricity that the refinery can save.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 2 space-separated integers: E,M.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer - the maximum amount of electricity that the refinery can save.

Constraints
1≤T≤50
1≤E,M≤10^5
M≤E

Explanation
Test case 1: The refinery can construct 5 machines and will utilize 2 units of electricity each. Thus, 3 units of electricity is saved.

Test case 2: The refinery can construct 2 machines and will utilize 3 units of electricity each. Thus, a single unit of electricity is saved.
